# Odd Day Coding

This repository is a personal consistency project.
I solve and document one coding problem every odd day to
strengthen problem-solving skills and maintain a sustainable routine.

Each solution includes:
- Clear approach
- Time & space complexity
- Clean, readable code

Will be updated in batches at times and python is used as the primary language for problem solving
